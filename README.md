# Layla Hendrix — Data Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Portfolio. This repository highlights a collection of end-to-end data, analytics, modeling, and engineering projects that demonstrate my technical depth, real-world problem solving, and commitment to building high-quality, reproducible data products. The projects span Python, R, machine learning, geospatial analytics, Dash app development, and large-scale time series forecasting.

Each project contains its own README with detailed methods, skills, and outcomes. Below is a consolidated overview of the portfolio.
